        <p>
        A TARGETED CV is a written overview of a personâ€™s experience and other
qualifications relevant to a job opportunity you have selected. Typically,
this is the first item an employer reads after your cover letter. It provides a
clear summary of your learning, so an employer can match your skills and
knowledge to the job vacancy. Use the targeted CV as a guide for you
during an interview.
