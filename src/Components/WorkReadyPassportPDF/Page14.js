        A TARGETED CV is a written overview of a personâ€™s experience and other qualifications relevant to a job opportunity you have selected. 
        Typically, this is the first item an employer reads after your cover letter. It provides a clear summary of your learning, so an
         employer can match your skills and knowledge to the job vacancy. Use the targeted CV as a guide for you during an interview.
