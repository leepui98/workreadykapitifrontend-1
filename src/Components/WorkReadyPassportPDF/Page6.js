        <p>
        Communication is simply the act of transferring information from one place to
another whether verbal, written or visual. Think about how you interact with
people in conversation. Do you make eye contact with people and do you
listen when being spoken to? Consider your written skills and the language
you use, both in writing and when speaking. Devices verse face to face â€“ do
you prefer to talk or text? If we asked your friends how you communicate
what would they say?
